Wetten tools
============

This repo contains a bunch of Ruby scripts that are used to

1. Populate a CouchDB database with Dutch laws, along with their metadata, and maintain it through time. [See documentation.](https://github.com/statengeneraal/tools-scripts/blob/master/scripts/laws_in_couchdb)
2. Populate a git repository that contains historical versions of Dutch laws in Markdown format. [See documentation.](https://github.com/statengeneraal/tools-scripts/blob/master/scripts)

There is also a [legacy](https://github.com/statengeneraal/tools-scripts/tree/master/legacy) that may have some interesting files for reference (Python scripts for scraping the BwbIdList; an XML schema for BwbIdList.)
