Legacy Tools
============

This folder contains some Python scripts used to fetch all XML documents from the government. This code is not used in any sort of production and is mainly for reference purposes.

`webservice/BWBIdList.xsd` contains an XML schema that I generated from the existing BWBIdList. It should validate, but use at you own peril.
